    "title": "About us",
    "first-part": "In the spring of 2022, the founder of the project, teacher Olena Chekryzhova, was asked by her friend to start an English course in his battalion. Olena lived at a military base for several months, teaching English every day, after which she trained officers and personnel at the headquarters and deployment sites, and worked with the military online.",
    "second-part": "In the first months, Olena unofficially called her initiative 'Special educational operation', later the project was named ENG for UARMY, and later the YouTube channel by the same name was launched. During the first year of activity, more than a hundred volunteers (Ukrainians and foreigners) contributed to the creation of the project and a wide variety of tasks.",
    "third-part": "We believe that language is a weapon. The more weapons we have, the closer our victory is. And the mission of our project is to equip the armed forces of Ukraine with English."
