    "name-1": "Taras",
    "role-1": "Commander of a Special Purpose Company, International Legion of Defense of Ukraine",
    "review-1": "The “Eng for UArmy” project is like an oasis in the desert of illiteracy. When working with soldiers of the Foreign Legion, the response time and successful task execution depend on our collective understanding and interaction. As a commander, it was vital for me to know military English. Thanks to the  “Eng for UArmy” project, I quickly learned critically important information that helped not only survive in the literal sense of the word but also save the lives of those in my unit. It is through projects like these that we will prevail.",
    "name-2": "Yuriy Kalmutskyi",
    "role-2": "Junior Sergeant",
    "review-2": "I'm very grateful for the English course provided for the military. In my past life, English was the language of communication with the whole world. It's a language that opens every door and provides new opportunities. Now, when the entire civilized world has extended a helping hand to us, we must quickly embrace and understand all the tools and opportunities that have become available in our arsenal to bring us closer to victory. Your course provides all the necessary knowledge in the military terminology of allied countries, includes a lot of language practice, and gives additional skills through specific examples.",
    "name-3": "Viktor Derevyanko",
    "role-3": "1st  Lieutenant, Instructor at the National Defense University of Ukraine",
    "review-3": "The “ENG for UARMY” course is an indispensable tool in preparing for joint defense projects and military operations with partners from other countries. Learning the English language has become a key factor in achieving military victory. It helps in communicating with allies, rapidly acquiring new knowledge, understanding instructions, and transmitting crucial information. The language course also broadens one's horizons, fosters flexibility in thinking, and opens doors to international resources and technologies. Recognizing the importance of this course establishes a solid foundation for a successful military career.",
    "name-4": "Oleksandr",
    "role-4": "Lieutenant, Combat Unit Management",
    "review-4": "I want to sincerely thank Olena for the Military English course. I refreshed my knowledge of English and had the chance to practice my pronunciation and grammar. The YouTube lessons are well-structured by topics, allowing me to choose the specific words and professional terminology that I need right now. Thanks to regular classes, I was able to expand my vocabulary in military terminology and significantly improve my English. Currently, I am applying this knowledge in my work with NATO weapon manuals, while watching military training videos, and keeping up with the news. This assistance has been valuable, as the experience of warfare and NATO standards differ from those in Ukraine.",
    "name-5": "Natalia",
    "role-5": "Chief of the Foreign Languages Education and Research Centre",
    "review-5": "The project is adapted to the demands and constraints currently limiting the military in language learning: absorbing maximum information in minimum time. The material is presented in an interesting way, combining Ukrainian and English languages: the main part is clearly in the native language while English terms are provided in an unforced yet intensive way. Undoubtedly - it's useful, very relevant, and I recommend its frequent practice. It's important to relate the learning with our current national context, which enhances understanding of new material. I'm sincerely grateful to Ms. Olena for her efforts, creative approach, and creativity.",
    "name-6": "Alla",
    "role-6": "Officer-Psychologist",
    "review-6": "I frequently use the English course for military personnel to improve my knowledge. Currently, I use English for educational purposes. I am an officer-psychologist, and a lot of educational materials and courses from our foreign colleagues are presented in English. One of my small victories, which ENG for UARMY helped me achieve, is that I was selected for training and further collaboration with a University in Texas on the research topic: Effective PTSD management techniques. Thank you for such valuable resources for the military. I recommend it to my brothers and sisters in arms.",
    "name-7": "Sergiy",
    "role-7": "Combat Medic",
    "review-7": "I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the ENG for UARMY team for the interesting and undeniably valuable informational product! In modern times, having a good command of the English language is increasingly important, both for communication with foreign colleagues and partners and for individual professional development. Your project helps to master a lot of useful vocabulary, especially in the military context, which is fantastic! I recommend everyone to join this course!",
    "name-8": "Lyudmyla Sinna",
    "role-8": "Associate Professor at the Department of Philology, Translation, and Strategic Comms at NANGU",
    "review-8": "My cadets actively watch your videos, meticulously studying the specifics of military language. This is especially convenient for those who are constantly on duty or missions. These videos are effective for preparing for classes; beginners, thanks to ENG for UARMY, actively engage in discussions and delve deeper into understanding the differences in military concepts. Thank you for your work!",
    "name-9": "Anastasiia Vradiy",
    "role-9": "Officer-Psychologist",
    "review-9": "For the soldiers who want to develop their professional skills and climb the career ladder, learning English is OBLIGATORY! And ENG for UARMY is a great help in these pursuits. My name is Anastasiia, and I serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I am a military psychologist in one of the units, and I understand that I need English for career growth. And that’s how ENG for UARMY helps me now and in the future!",

    "role-10": "Professor of the Department of Foreign Languages at the Military Academy (Odesa), employee of the Armed Forces of Ukraine",
    "review-10": "ENG for UArmy is a great tool for learning military English. If you want to understand the intricacies of the names of branches of the armed forces, military ranks, equipment and weapons, you have come to the right place. I use this resource personally and also advise my cadets to use it as a source of the most relevant military vocabulary.",
    "name-11": "Illia",
    "role-11": "Ukrainian combat veteran",
    "review-11": "I give my best regards to everyone who creates and supports ENG for UARMY. Every week, I listen to English lessons on YouTube and use the Telegram channel to improve my language skills. I meet with a volunteer from the UK once or twice a week. This program is very important for our people, army, and country. Ukrainian soldiers use many types of NATO weaponry. To use those they need to know the English language. Ukraine’s education system cannot teach so many people in this specific direction. This program gives our military the ability to learn Military English, and it is one of the best ways to improve their language skills."

Olena then lived on a military base for several months, teaching soldiers English daily, eventually training officers and personnel at the headquarters and deployment locations as well as working with the military online.",
    "second-part": "During the initial months, Olena unofficially called her initiative a 'Special educational operation', and the project was later named ENG for UARMY, followed by the launch of its YouTube channel. In its first year, more than a hundred volunteers (Ukrainians and foreigners) contributed to the creation of the project and a wide variety of tasks.",
    "third-part": "We believe that language is a weapon. The more weapons we have, the closer we are to victory. And the mission of our project is to equip the Armed Forces of Ukraine with English."
