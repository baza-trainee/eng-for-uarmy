    "review-1": "The project is adapted to the demands and constraints currently limiting the military in language learning: absorbing maximum information in minimum time. The material is presented in an interesting way, combining Ukrainian and English languages: the main part is clearly in the native language while English terms are provided in an unforced yet intensive way. Undoubtedly - it's useful, very relevant, and I recommend its frequent practice. It's important to relate the learning with our current national context, which enhances understanding of new material. I'm sincerely grateful to Ms. Olena for her efforts, creative approach, and creativity.",

    "review-2": "The “Eng for UArmy” project is like an oasis in the desert of illiteracy. When working with soldiers of the Foreign Legion, the response time and successful task execution depend on our collective understanding and interaction. As a commander, it was vital for me to know military English. Thanks to the  “Eng for UArmy” project, I quickly learned critically important information that helped not only survive in the literal sense of the word but also save the lives of those in my unit. It is through projects like these that we will prevail.",

    "role-2": "Commander of a Special Purpose Company, International Legion of Defense of Ukraine",
    "review-3": "ENG for UArmy is a great tool for learning military English. If you want to understand the intricacies of the names of branches of the armed forces, military ranks, equipment and weapons, you have come to the right place. I use this resource personally and also advise my cadets to use it as a source of the most relevant military vocabulary.",

    "title": "About us",
    "first-part": "In the spring of 2022, the founder of the project and teacher, Olena Chekryzhova, was asked by her friend to start an English course in his battalion. Olena then lived on a military base for several months, teaching soldiers English daily, eventually training officers and personnel at the headquarters and deployment locations as well as working with the military online.",
    "second-part": "During the initial months, Olena unofficially called her initiative a 'Special educational operation', and the project was later named ENG for UARMY, followed by the launch of its YouTube channel. In its first year, more than a hundred volunteers (Ukrainians and foreigners) contributed to the creation of the project and a wide variety of tasks.",
    "third-part": "We believe that language is a weapon. The more weapons we have, the closer we are to victory. And the mission of our project is to equip the Armed Forces of Ukraine with English."
